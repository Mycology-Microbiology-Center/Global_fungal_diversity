# Connecting the multiple dimensions of global soil fungal diversity

How the multiple facets of soil fungal diversity vary worldwide remains virtually unknown, 
hindering the management of this essential species-rich group. 
By sequencing high-resolution DNA markers in over 4000 topsoil samples 
from natural and human-altered ecosystems across all continents, 
we illustrate the distributions and drivers of different levels of 
taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of fungi and their ecological groups. 
We show the impact of precipitation and temperature interactions on fungal 
local species richness (alpha diversity) across different climates. 
Our findings reveal how temperature drives fungal compositional turnover (beta diversity) 
and phylogenetic diversity, linking them with regional species richness (gamma diversity). 
Our work integrates fungi into the principles of global biodiversity distribution 
and presents detailed maps for biodiversity conservation and modeling of global ecological processes.  

## Geographic distribution of study sites

The map, presented in Goode's homolosine projection, 
shows the exact locations where the research was conducted, each marked by a dot. 
The different colors of the dots signify various types of land cover.
